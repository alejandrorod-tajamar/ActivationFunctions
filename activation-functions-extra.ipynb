    "## **What are Activation Functions?**\n",
    "In artificial neural networks, each neuron forms a weighted sum of its inputs and passes the resulting scalar value through a function referred to as an activation function or transfer function. If a neuron has n inputs $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ then the output of a neuron is:\n",
    "$$a = g(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + ... + w_nx_n + b)$$\n",
    "The function $g$ is referred to as the activation function. If the function $g$ is taken as the linear function $g(z) = z$ then the neuron performs linear regression or classification. In general $g$ is taken to be a nonlinear function to do nonlinear regression and solve classification problems that are not linearly separable. When $g$ is taken to be a sigmoidal or 's' shaped function varying from 0 to 1 or -1 to 1, the output value of the neuron can be interpreted as a YES/NO answer or binary decision. However saturating activation function can cause the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks. Replacing saturating sigmoidal activation functions with activation functions like ReLU that have larger derivative values allowed deeper networks to be trained for the first time. Non-monotonic and oscillating activation functions that significantly outperform ReLU have since been found. In particular oscillating activation functions improve gradient flow, speedup training and allow single neurons to learn the XOR function like certain human cerebral neurons.\n",

For example, functions like ReLU do not saturate in the positive region, allowing gradients to remain significant, thus helping deep networks to continue learning effectively as the number of layers increases.\n",
